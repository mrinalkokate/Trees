# Trees

<h2>Decision Tree Classifier<h2>

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.
The name itself suggests that it uses a flowchart like a tree structure to show the predictions that result from a series of feature-based splits. It starts with a root node and ends with a decision made by leaves.

<h2>The data preparation process involves several key steps:<h2>

  - **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from various sources like operational systems, data warehouses, and data lakes. Ensure collected data aligns with the objectives of planned analytics applications.

  - <b> **Data Discovery and Profiling**: Explore collected data to understand its content and requirements for preparation. Data profiling identifies patterns, relationships, inconsistencies, and missing values.

 - <b> **Data Cleansing:** Correct identified data errors and issues to create complete and accurate datasets. Remove or fix faulty data, fill in missing values, and harmonize inconsistent entries.

 - <b> **Data Structuring:** Model and organize data to meet analytics requirements. Convert data into structured formats like tables for accessibility to BI and analytics tools.

- <b>  **Data Transformation and Enrichment:** Transform data into a unified and usable format. Create new fields or columns by aggregating values from existing ones. Enhance data through enrichment measures like augmenting and adding data.

- <b> **Data Validation and Publishing**: Run automated routines to validate data consistency, completeness, and accuracy. Store prepared data in repositories like data warehouses or data lakes. Make it available for direct use or access by other users.

<h2> GRIDSEARCH <h2>
<sub>Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique used to systematically search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins, such as the learning rate, regularization strength, or the number of hidden units in a neural network.</sub>
